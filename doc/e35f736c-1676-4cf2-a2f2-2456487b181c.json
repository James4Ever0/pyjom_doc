    "summary": "The code defines a translator function that randomly selects from multiple translation services to convert English text to either \"zh\" or \"zh-CHS\". It uses the \"translators\" module and imports random for selecting the translation service and language. The code also allows for different combinations of translation services to be tested by uncommenting specific lines in the mtranslators list. If an error occurs during translation, it prints the exception stack trace using traceback.",
