It specifies a list of supported languages (English, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Japanese), combines them into a single language code, and applies it to the \"test_render.png\" image file. The resulting extracted text is then printed out. However, there may be many incorrect results due to the complexity of character recognition in different languages.",
