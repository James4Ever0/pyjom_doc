It first defines the directories containing the image files, then iterates over each directory, lists the files, and checks if the file name matches the corresponding tarot card number in Roman or Arabic numeral form. If a match is found, it assigns that image file to the respective dictionary (mtarget_0 for Arabic numbers, mtarget_1 for tarot card names). Finally, it removes any missing mappings from the dictionaries.",
