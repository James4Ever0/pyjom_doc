    "summary": "This code uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and imagehash module to calculate average color hash values for images. It opens three images, 'pic_0', 'pic_0_similar', and 'pic_1', calculates their color hash values using the phash function from imagehash, and then calculates the differences between the hashes of each pair of images. The code checks the types of the calculated hashes and prints the distances (dis0 and dis1) between the pairs of images. It also mentions a possible discrepancy in the expected number of digits for the distances.",
